# Smart-Recycling-Contract

- Proposal of Smart Recycling Contract

Smart Recycling Contract is a proposal for recycling the plastic materials generated by some companies and it should be recycled back to them. For instance, if a food packaging company selling their food packages and they are recycling the plastic waste of those food packages.

For this purpose, we made a smart decentralized application with a smart contract for the communication between the manufacture and the recycler. As the name indicates “SMART RECYCLING CONTRACTS”, it reduces the manpower needed to handle the recycling process. There is no intermediate person communicating between the manufacturer and the recycler. 

The manufacturer can join into a block in the decentralized app using LOGIN and signed up as a manufacturer and he/she can able to add the products which they want to recycle by the recycler and send to the recycler. 

The recycler can also login to the decentralized app using a blockchain account and register or sign up as a recycler. Then the recycler can able to view the order from the manufacture and act based on the order. Once the recycler sorted the products of recycling, he will change the status that the ordered request from manufacture is recycled.

Once the status changed, the manufacture will get the recycled product and he should pay the recycler.
